# The Fair Token Project

Something we don't see enough is transparency in smart contracts. We want to bring some change to that. Why? Skimming through the latest meme coin crazes, we see people apeing into coins that are obvious honeypots, have ridiculously high burn ratios, and contain other serious red flags.
